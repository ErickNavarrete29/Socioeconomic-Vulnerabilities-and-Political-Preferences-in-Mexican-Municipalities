# Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities and Political Preferences in Mexican Municipalities

## Project Description (Abstract)

This study focuses on identifying the elements involved in the political
preferences in the Mexican municipalities during the Major elections of 2018 and 2021
to detect if exists a relationship between socioeconomic vulnerabilities and the preference
for some parties as many people argue each election. The methodology used is
quantitative with a data panel that structures the electoral preference of each municipality
as a dependent variable with the created variables “winner_2018” and “winner_2021”,
taking as independent variables the vulnerability index proposed by the National Council
for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval). With multiple linear
regression, we found that for 2018 the access to health services and the percentage of
people in extreme poverty have statistical significance, and for 2021 only the first one

has statistical significance. This demonstrates that the arguments created around socio-
economic vulnerabilities and the relationship with voting preferences could be a stigma 
created to underestimate the capacity of people living with vulnerabilities to decide their
political preferences.

Keywords: vulnerabilities, Mexico, political parties, municipalities, poverty, political
preferences.
