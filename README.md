# Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities and Political Preferences in Mexican Municipalities

## Project Description (Abstract)

This study focuses on identifying the elements involved in the political
preferences in the Mexican municipalities during the Major elections of 2018 and 2021
to detect if exists a relationship between socioeconomic vulnerabilities and the preference
for some parties as many people argue each election. The methodology used is
quantitative with a data panel that structures the electoral preference of each municipality
as a dependent variable with the created variables “winner_2018” and “winner_2021”,
taking as independent variables the vulnerability index proposed by the National Council
for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval). With multiple linear
regression, we found that for 2018 the access to health services and the percentage of
people in extreme poverty have statistical significance, and for 2021 only the first one

has statistical significance. This demonstrates that the arguments created around socio-
economic vulnerabilities and the relationship with voting preferences could be a stigma 
created to underestimate the capacity of people living with vulnerabilities to decide their
political preferences.

Keywords: vulnerabilities, Mexico, political parties, municipalities, poverty, political
preferences.

## Getting Started

For this project it was used the R studio Program, and it was reuiqered to have installed the packages of dplyr, raster, GISTools and Readxl

## File Structure - Introduction

Inequality and “classism” are one of manly the socioeconomic challenges of Mexican society.
México is one of the most unequal countries, not only in the region but in the world (Jusidman,
2009), and even if the official data may show little advances in some economic sectors like the
remittances and rural activities diversification, the situation of far from being resolved, and this
has caused that other related problems to appear in different arenas, like the political, as the
inequality has historical roots and with the past of time it has found a way to be expressed in a
multifactorial form.
In the political arena we can find that it exists a discourse of discrimination that seeks to
humiliate somehow or to decrease the value of the opinion of the poorest sector of the population
in its political preferences, making derogatory – and indeed with no evidence – on the political
preferences. In the last years has become quite regular to listen to or read accusations on how the
more vulnerable people tend to vote for one or another party, but there is always as background
the need of the people to be themselves in a privileged position against the otherness, where if you
vote for a determined party, then you are poor, and hence, worse than the others.
The current situation of inequality in Mexico has reached nowadays point after several
decades of economic, social, and political processes, nevertheless, analysis of this is not the aim
of the current essay; in the other hand, the discussion on the national level on the impact that has
de economic level of the individuals on their electoral preferences is relatively new, as during a
major part of the XX century, the political power in the country was concentrated in the same
political party, the National Revolutionary Party (PNR) since 1928 held the control of the Congress
and Executive power, a tendency that continue with its successor (same party but refunded) the
today alive Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
This party kept the Federal Presidency of Mexico until the year 2000 when the National
Action Party (PAN) won the Presidency of the country, giving an end to 72 years of un-interrupted
PRI government, starting officially an alternate and somehow giving space to a different spectrum
of possibilities for pluralism in the country. Here is needed to have in consideration, that in Mexico
four main parties hold a national presence (and are officially recognized), the already mentioned
PRI and PAN, the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), and the recently created National
Regeneration Movement (Morena). From these parties, we can draw a political location of ideals,
as the PAN is considered a right-wing party, the PRI a Center party, the PRD a left party, and Morena a left-wing party (considered a far-left wing party due to its positions of support to other
far left-wing regimes in the international arena).
Despite the 2000’s alternate mentioned above, in 2012, the historical party, PRI returned to
power, but in 2018 the most recent political force, Morena, managed to win the presidential spot
having as a major slogan the phrase “The poor people first”. With the more and more common
changes of political force in the power, different approaches to analysis started to appear claiming
the possibility of a correlation between the political preferences that related the poorest to vote for
a specific party, but no evidence supports the existence of such correlation.
And at the same time that academic studies started to appear, in social media (mainly
Twitter and Facebook) the spread of aggressive messages on the vision that different sector has on
the electoral basis of different parties, accusing the more educated sector of the population, and
the one with less social and economic vulnerabilities supports one or another specific political
force, but again, in this exchange of declarations, there is a lack of information or data that give
further back-up to the arguments.
Hence, there is where this line wants to give a response to the question: Do socioeconomic
vulnerabilities impact the political preferences at the municipality level in Mexico? For giving an
answer to this and trying to break with the tendency of trying to measure the political preferences
in the federalism arena, we will consider the electoral preference in the elections of Mayors in the
municipalities of the whole country. We aim to analyze the dynamics between socioeconomic
vulnerabilities and political preferences at the municipal level in Mexico, resulting in a better
understanding of the underlying factors that influence electoral behavior having into consideration
socioeconomic challenges, this is a first step towards the identification of correlations between the
needs and aspirations of vulnerable communities and their electoral preference.

With this research, students of social sciences, policymakers, consultancy firms, and NGOs
that work with political participation and social vulnerability, can have a more reliable back-up on
the idea of the impact that social vulnerabilities have on the political preference of the Mexican
voters. Our hypothesis lies on the premise that socioeconomic vulnerabilities have a significant
impact on political preferences at the municipality level in Mexico, with higher levels of
vulnerability correlating with certain political ideologies and voting patterns. Nevertheless, as a
null hypothesis, we have the opposite core idea, where the social vulnerabilities won’t have any
sort of correlation, or at least not any significance.
To demonstrate which hypothesis is achieved, it will be used a multiple correlation model,
where we will consider the political preference of each city as the dependent variable with the
created variable for each period studied: “winner_2018” and “winner_2021”, and as independent
variables different indicators of vulnerability in the same level, like the presence of poverty,
extreme poverty, educational backwardness, lack of access to services of health and social security,
and the lack of quality in the household materials and services, this taken from the index proposed
by the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval).
